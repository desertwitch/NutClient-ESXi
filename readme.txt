PURPOSE OF THE MODIFICATION

To modify the orginal project (see below) exchanging the SMTP
notifications with push notifications via the (free) Prowl service.

This package aims to allow hobbyist users to receive NUT notifications
from their ESXI hypervisor without the need for complicated SMTP setups.

CONFIGURATION OF THE MODIFICATION

- Follow the INSTALL instructions of the original project README
- Follow the CONFIGURATION instructions of the original project README

- Reconfigure these original parameters to activate the modification :
   UserVars.NutSendMail = 1
   UserVars.NutMailTo = YOUR PROWL API KEY GOES HERE

- When you change the values of the UserVars you MUST restart NUT client service
  to reload the configuration.

---- BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PROJECT / ORIGINAL README SEE BELOW ----

PURPOSE

Provide UPS connectivity to a single vSphere Hypervisor 5.0 to 8.0
Will shut down properly the host and vms with vmware-tools installed
if a NUT server tells that the power supply has gone and the UPS
battery level is critical.

INSTALL

- Enable SSH on the hypervisor.
- Copy via scp this TAR archive to /tmp directory of the hypervisor
- Connect via ssh to the hypervisor and type the followind commands

    cd /tmp
    tar -xzvf NutClient-ESXi-2.8.0-2.4.2.x86_64.tar.gz
    ./upsmon-install.sh

- No need to reboot, upsmon can be started immediatly but you need
  to configure it first
- You can delete tmp files and disable SSH on the hypervisor

UPDATE

- Same as install but use ./upsmon-update.sh

UNINSTALL

- Same as install but use ./upsmon-remove.sh

CONFIGURATION

- Start vSphere Client and go to configuration tab of the hypervisor
- Open Advanced Parameters and go to UserVars
- Configure these parameters to match your needs :
   UserVars.NutUpsName        : UPS name on remote NUT server
                                (ups_name@server_name), can be a space
                                separated list of NUT servers.
   UserVars.NutUser           : Username to connect to NUT server.
                                If more that one NUT server is declared,
                                all need to use the same user/password
   UserVars.NutPassword       : Username password on NUT server.
   UserVars.NutFinalDelay     : Seconds to wait on low battery event
                                before shutting down.
   UserVars.NutOnBatteryDelay : Seconds to wait running on battery
                                before shutting down. Default is 0 to
                                disable this feature and wait for low
                                battery event before shutting down.
   UserVars.NutMinSupplies    : Number of power supplies needed to keep
                                the system running.
   UserVars.NutSendMail       : Set to 1 if you want a mail to be sent
                                on UPS events.
   UserVars.NutMailTo         : Email address to send mail to on UPS events.

- If you don't see UserVars parameters restart hostd service on
  hypervisor only if you have no vmware job running
    /etc/init.d/hostd restart
  You will need to reconnect with the client
- Now you can start and enable NUT client on hypervisor boot
- On configuration tab of the hypervisor go to Security Profile
- Open services properties
- Select Network UPS Tools client an click on Options
- When you change the values of the UserVars you MUST restart NUT client service
  to reload the configuration.
